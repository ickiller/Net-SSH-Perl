Is there any way to use Rhosts-RSA auth without running as root?

Add more tests to the test suite.

Can we run multiple commands in the same SSH session? Perhaps open
up a shell on the remote machine? The trouble with this is that
it requires parsing the STDOUT data for the command line prompt.

Add SSH2 implementation.
