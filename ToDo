Add more tests to the test suite; add SSH2 tests.

Fixes to SSH2 implementation:
    * get rid of dummy shell channel (if possible)
    * more documentation
    * anything currently marked XXX in the code

Compatibility with NetScreen?

Switch over to using Crypt::RSA for SSH1 RSA implementation.

Switch completely to Math::Pari.

Use non-blocking connect, like IO::Socket, to implement a
Timeout.

A proper scp client.
