Revision history for Net::SSH::Perl

0.65
    - fixed bug with "Cipher <name>" in config file or 'options'
      param. This wasn't mapping ssh cipher names to Net::SSH::Perl
      cipher names (ie. should map 'idea' => 'IDEA'). Thanks to
      Edward Vopata (vopata@pulsar.itg.ti.com) for the spot and
      a patch.
    - made it clearer that Net::SSH::Perl currently supports only
      SSH1 protocol.
    - better error checking for getservbyname lookup of ssh
      service (to get default port).
    - added eg/remoteinteract.pl, which demonstrates how to interact
      with a remote (interactive) command.

0.64  2001.03.13
    - fixed bug in Net::SSH::Perl::Cipher::new_from_key_str;
      empty key string (passphrase) was broken. This never
      cropped up in regular usage, only in testing.
    - added _save_private_key function to Net::SSH::Perl::Util,
      used to save private key files.
    - added cipher tests (05-cipher.t).
    - PasswordPromptLogin and PasswordPromptHost config options
      are now supported (on by default).
    - added untainting code for all places where data is read
      from external sources (ie. socket, key files, etc.),
      which should fix the "Corrupted check bytes" errors when
      using -T. It was breaking because substr replacement
      doesn't work on tainted values. See this p5p thread:
      http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing-lists/perl5-porters/2000-09/msg00799.html

0.63  2001.03.09
    - added documentation to pssh (eg/pssh), as well as a -V
      option.
    - fixed bug where User specified in config file would be
      overridden by lack of user in login method.
    - return value of buffer->dump method no longer contains
      extra space at the end.

0.62  2001.03.08
    - fixed test bug with StringThing package by adding FILENO
      method. Should fix problem with 5.6 test suite.
    - added merge_directive method to Net::SSH::Perl::Config,
      and 'options' arg to Net::SSH::Perl constructor.

0.61  2001.03.07
    - changed in_leftover implementation and name. The method
      is now named incoming_data, and the implementation is
      a Net::SSH::Perl::Buffer object.
    - changed to using non-blocking sockets. Net::SSH::Perl::Packet
      added a read_poll method, which doesn't block; read still
      blocks (using select).
    - added shell connection functionality, and abstracted out
      interactive session code a bit better. Added pty support.
      In the future 'shell' could conceivably be used to execute
      multiple commands over the same ssh connection.
    - added 3DES as fallback cipher if IDEA isn't supported.
    - _check_host_in_hostfile now returns HOST_NEW if the hostfile
      can't be opened, consistent with how ssh and openssh work.

0.60  2001.03.02
    - added compression support, along with Compression and
      CompressionLevel config directives, and docs
    - added ability to register handlers for specific packet
      types read during the client loop

0.53  2001.02.28
    - added Net::SSH::Perl::Config; reads ssh config files
      and merges constructor options with config options
    - updated DESCRIPTION for Net::SSH::Perl

0.52  2001.02.21
    - added ability to specify RSA identity files; defaults
      to "$ENV{HOME}/.ssh/identity"
    - Blowfish cipher will try to use Crypt::Blowfish_PP if
      it can't use Crypt::Blowfish
    - added lots of POD
    - fixed bug where unknown hosts wouldn't be added to
      hostfile
    - sorted out common sections between Net::SSH::Perl POD
      and README

0.51  2001.02.20
    - Blowfish support has now been added.

0.50  2001.02.19
    - moved my Net::SSH libraries into the Net::SSH::Perl
      namespace; hooked up the main Net::SSH interface lib.
    - added ssh and issh wrappers around OO methods.
    - added configure method to Net::SSH interface; used to
      set up connection params when using procedural
      interface.
    - added RSA authentication.
    - ripped out IO::Socket usage, replaced with manual
      socket creation and connection so we can try to bind to
      ports 1023 down through 512, if the user wants to
      connect on a privileged port.
    - added Rhosts-RSA and Rhosts authentication, with the
      caveat that they only work when running as root
      and on a privileged port.

0.03  2001.01.19
    - integrated modified CBC and CFB ciphers into distribution;
      no more reliance on Crypt::CFB and Crypt::CBC
    - improved cipher checking; added list of ciphers supported
      by client, based on which cipher drivers can be loaded
    - fixed rsa_private_decrypt bug (occurred when session key
      int was 255 chars long as hex string, rather than 256).
    - Chip Turner, author of Math::GMP, added my patch to his
      distribution, thus making installation much easier. Thanks
      Chip.
    - added cipher support to installation process.
    - abstracted the auth plugins into Auth modules; this will
      allow the addition of other authentication modules in
      the future.
    - moved utility routines into Net::SSH::Util.
    - changed Net::SSH::Constants to use Exporter.

0.02  2001.01.18
    - added DES and 3DES ciphers
    - more host key support: adds new host keys to user host key file
    - checked for unsupported Net::SSH::Buffer methods in AUTOLOAD
    - added example script, eg/cmd.pl
    - can now specify cipher via new method
    - checks against server's supported cipher list

0.01  2001.01.10
    - original version; created by h2xs 1.19
