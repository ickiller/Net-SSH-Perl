Revision history for Perl extension Net::SSH::Perl.

0.04  Mon Feb 5 13:52:02 2001
        - moved my Net::SSH libraries into the Net::SSH::Perl
          namespace; hooked up the main Net::SSH interface lib.
        - added ssh and issh wrappers around OO methods.
        - added configure method to Net::SSH interface; used to
          set up connection params when using procedural
          interface.
        - added RSA authentication.
        - ripped out IO::Socket usage, replaced with manual
          socket creation and connection so we can try to bind to
          ports 1023 down through 512, if the user wants to
          connect on a privileged port.
        - added Rhosts-RSA and Rhosts authentication, with the
          caveat that they only work when running as root
          and on a privileged port.

0.03  Fri Jan 19 17:52:34 2001
        - integrated modified CBC and CFB ciphers into distribution;
          no more reliance on Crypt::CFB and Crypt::CBC
        - improved cipher checking; added list of ciphers supported
          by client, based on which cipher drivers can be loaded
        - fixed rsa_private_decrypt bug (occurred when session key
          int was 255 chars long as hex string, rather than 256).
        - Chip Turner, author of Math::GMP, added my patch to his
          distribution, thus making installation much easier. Thanks
          Chip.
        - added cipher support to installation process.
        - abstracted the auth plugins into Auth modules; this will
          allow the addition of other authentication modules in
          the future.
        - moved utility routines into Net::SSH::Util.
        - changed Net::SSH::Constants to use Exporter.

0.02  Thu Jan 18 14:39:15 2001
        - added DES and 3DES ciphers
        - more host key support: adds new host keys to user host key file
        - checked for unsupported Net::SSH::Buffer methods in AUTOLOAD
        - added example script, eg/cmd.pl
        - can now specify cipher via new method
        - checks against server's supported cipher list
