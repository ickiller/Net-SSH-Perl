This is Net::SSH::Perl.

PREREQUISITES

    * Math::GMP (1.04 or greater)
    * String::CRC32 (1.2 or greater)
    * Digest::MD5

INSTALLATION

Net::SSH::Perl installation is relatively straightforward. If
your CPAN shell is set up, you should just be able to do

    % perl -MCPAN -e 'install Net::SSH::Perl'

If you don't like that, you can download the distribution; the
latest version on CPAN can be found in

    ftp://ftp.cpan.org/pub/CPAN/authors/id/B/BT/BTROTT/

Download it, unpack it, then build it as per the usual:

    % perl Makefile.PL
    % make && make test

Then install it:

    % make install

If you have problems, read on.

The only slightly complicated bit in the installation is
that you'll need to install Crypt:: modules depending on
which ciphers you wish to use. Much work has gone into
making this simple; you should be asked a question about
which ciphers you'll use, and the modules should be
downloaded and installed automatically.

If it doesn't work, or if you don't like this option, you'll
need to do the installations manually. In which case you'll
need to install Math::GMP (version 1.04 or later),
String::CRC32 (version 1.2 or later), and Digest::MD5, plus
any additional Crypt:: modules you wish to use.

SAMPLES/TUTORIALS

Take a look at the scripts in eg/ for help and examples of
using Net::SSH::Perl. eg/cmd.pl is just a simple example of
some of the functionality, eg/pssh is an ssh-like client
for running commands on remote servers and connecting to a
shell on remote servers, and eg/pscp is a very simple
scp-like script. Both pssh and pscp support a subset
of the command line options that the actual tools support;
obviously, only those options supported by Net::SSH::Perl are
supported by the two scripts.
